Hi, my name is Ray! 

If you were about to say `Hello Raymond`, hold it right there! I know, you want to be polite and express respect, but my full name is `Ray of light`, not `Raymond`. It is an unusual name, isn't it?

If you were about to say `Yes!`, hold it right there! It may seem unusual to you, but it is very familiar to me. In fact, where I come from - this is the only name there is! All my brothers and sisters share it, and I have a loooooot of siblings.


How many, you ask? Try to guess! Maybe you have a sibling, so there are two of you. Or maybe you have a friend who has two brothers - so there are three of them. Three is not even close! Think of the biggest number you can, take your time....

I am quite sure that even if you take that number and make it a hundred times bigger, it is still too small!  So think of an even bigger number!

Wait, don't say anything yet. Whatever it is, think of something even bigger than that!

Aaah, I told you not to hurry! Pause for a few moments and think about it. Close your eyes, I'll be here when you come back, don't worry.



What is it? A hundred? A thousand? Five thousand?

Haha! Not even close! 

A thousand is ten times bigger than a hundred. There are probably about one thousand children in your school. 

A million is a thousand times bigger than a thousand. Does that sound big enough for you?

Wait, that is not all! A billion is a thousand times bigger than a million

I have billions of billions of billions of brothers and sisters, we all look alike and we all have the same name.

The Sun is our home, that is where we are born. That bright spot you see on the sky during the day is where I come from.

----------

All of us are natural born travelers, we love to travel! If you stay with me for a while, I will tell you everything about one of my recent trips.


It began many millions of years ago. I know, I know - you are asking yourself how is it possible for me to be a child, like you - even though I am millions of years old.

What is the catch, you ask? Hmmm..  Before you ask, try to think about it. Don't guess, think. If I am millions of years old, then it must mean that my parents are even older than that, say - a hundred millions?

Or maybe I can't count correctly, that's possible too!


Well, my story is quite simple - I was born inside the sun, and even though I got out of there just a few seconds ago, it took me millions of years to get to the surface. It is like talking to your mommy and asking her to go outside and play. She might say "Sweetie, you can go out and play for an hour", but it takes you two hours to convince her.

Something similar happened to me. It took me millions of years to convince the sun to let me go, and I've been playing outside for a few seconds now.

But... enough about me! Tell me something about yourself! How old are you? What is your name? After I get to know you a little bit better, I will tell you about my trip, as I understand that you really want to know about that.

Just think of the answers to those questions and imagine that you're talking to me - that will do.


---------

My trip began on a.... aah! I almost said `sunny day`, but I forgot to tell you that up here, near the sun - there is no day or night. It is always sunny and there is always light. You might say `So this means that the trip began on a sunny day`, but I don't think so. If there is a day, it means there is a night too - but in my case, there is no night. And if there is no night, why should there be a day?

Aah, let's get back to this later, I should tell you about my trip, instead of playing with words.


My trip is very long, so I must move very fast if I don't want to get bored. How fast, you ask? Let's see...

Think of how fast you can run. And think of others who can run too. For example, can your mother run faster than you? If yes, think of someone who can run faster than your mother. Perhaps it is your father.

Can he run faster than a dog? What about something even faster - maybe a car? Can you think of something faster than that? A plane, perhaps?

Planes are very fast indeed, but I suspect you're already thinking that I can be faster than a plane. After all, I have billions of brothers, I am millions of years old... So far, every time I ask you to think about my questions, I later tell you `think bigger` or `longer`. This time I am telling you `even faster`!

In fact, no one can move faster than me! Rays of light, such as myself, are the fastest things in the entire world! Nothing can outrun us, not even the fastest plane.

I am so fast, that by the time you pronounce your name, I can go from China to The Netherlands and back, and I will do it almost 20 times!

Let's try an experiment. Look for a map of the world, then find Beijing in China and Amsterdam in The Netherlands. If you can't find them, ask a friend to help you with that. When you're done, pronounce your name aloud. 

You can do it right now, one, two, three, go!


It probably took you a second to say your name, and this was just enough time for me to travel from one city to another, back and forth. That's pretty fast, isn't it?


It will take me a little bit over one second to go from the Earth to the Moon, that's how fast I am!


Now that you know how fast I am, let me tell you something else - I can't stop. In fact, if I stop - I disappear! So the only way for me to stay alive is to keep moving, otherwise I vanish.

So... I have no choice but to travel. And I learned to enjoy it too, otherwise it would be a great waste of time, wouldn't it?

Mercury //193s
=======

As soon as I took off from the Sun, I saw a little ball nearby, it was Mercury. It took me around 3 minutes to get to it. You say 3 minutes is not that much time? Think about what you can do in 3 minutes... Get up, brush your teeth and get dressed? Or maybe that is how long it takes you to get home from the nearest bus-stop?

Remember, it takes a second for me to travel from the Earth to the Moon; now try to imagine what I can do in 3 minutes! That is 180 seconds (because every minute has 60 seconds, and if you multiply that by 3, you get 180), so I can go to the Moon and back 180 times while you're getting dressed. Cool, huh!?

Oh, wait... I just told you to multiply some numbers, but you probably don't know how to do that. Well, I'll tell you what, some time later I will try to teach you how to do that. Until then, just trust me. Oh, and yes - it wouldn't hurt if you ask your mom or dad to do the multiplications for us too, such that if I made a mistake, you can tell me about it.

But... let me go back to Mercury. It is a little gray rock, with many holes in it. These holes are called `craters`, they are formed when something falls on the surface of the planet.

Did you ever through a pebble into a puddle? Or a rock in a pond? Go ahead and try it next time you're outside, if you haven't done so already. Notice that when the rock hits the water, a round hole is formed around it, along with some ripples. In a few moments, the water comes back and the hole is gone. After a while, the ripples fade away too.

A crater forms in a similar way, but unlike in the case of water - where in a few seconds everything comes back to normal, when a rock hits the ground - the hole is going to remain there for a very long time, maybe even forever!
