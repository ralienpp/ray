Hi, my name is Ray! 

If you were about to say `Hello Raymond`, hold it right there! I know, you want to be polite and express respect, but my full name is `Ray of light`, not `Raymond`. It is an unusual name, isn't it?

If you were about to say `Yes!`, hold it right there! It may seem unusual to you, but it is very familiar to me. In fact, where I come from - this is the only name there is! All my brothers and sisters share it, and I have a loooooot of siblings.


How many, you ask? Try to guess! Maybe you have a sibling, so there are two of you. Or maybe you have a friend who has two brothers - so there are three of them. Three is not even close! Think of the biggest number you can, take your time....

I am quite sure that even if you take that number and make it a hundred times bigger, it is still too small!  So think of an even bigger number!

Wait, don't say anything yet. Whatever it is, think of something even bigger than that!

.. image:: <thinking child>

Aaah, I told you not to hurry! Pause for a few moments and think about it. Close your eyes, I'll be here when you come back, don't worry.



What is it? A hundred? A thousand? Five thousand? 

.. image:: pic 1.000

Haha! Not even close! 

A thousand is ten times bigger than a hundred. There are probably about one thousand children in your school. 

A million is a thousand times bigger than a thousand. Does that sound big enough for you?

.. image:: pic 1.000.000 million to thousand

Wait, that is not all! A billion is a thousand times bigger than a million

.. image:: pic 1.000.000.000


I have billions of billions of billions of brothers and sisters, we all look alike and we all have the same name.

The Sun is our home, that is where we are born. That bright spot you see on the sky during the day is where I come from.

----------

All of us are natural born travelers, we love to travel! If you stay with me for a while, I will tell you everything about one of my recent trips.


It began many millions of years ago. I know, I know - you are asking yourself how is it possible for me to be a child, like you - even though I am millions of years old.

What is the catch, you ask? Hmmm..  Before you ask, try to think about it. Don't guess, think. If I am millions of years old, then it must mean that my parents are even older than that, say - a hundred millions?

Or maybe I can't count correctly, that's possible too!


Well, my story is quite simple - I was born inside the sun, and even though I got out of there just a few seconds ago, it took me millions of years to get to the surface. It is like talking to your mommy and asking her to go outside and play. She might say `Sweetie, you can go out and play for an hour`, but it takes you two hours to convince her.

Something similar happened to me. It took me millions of years to convince the sun to let me go, and I've been playing outside for a few seconds now.

But... enough about me! Tell me something about yourself! How old are you? What is your name? After I get to know you a little bit better, I will tell you about my trip, as I understand that you really want to know about that.

Just think of the answers to those questions and imagine that you're talking to me - that will do for now.


---------

My trip began on a.... aah! I almost said `sunny day`, but I forgot to tell you that up here, near the sun - there is no day or night. It is always sunny and there is always light. You might say `So this means that the trip began on a sunny day`, but I don't think so. If there is a day, it means there is a night too - but in my case, there is no night. And if there is no night, why should there be a day?

Aah, let's get back to this later, I should tell you about my trip, instead of playing with words.


My trip is very long, so I must move very fast if I don't want to get bored. How fast, you ask? Let's see...

Think of how fast you can run. And think of others who can run too. For example, can your mother run faster than you? If yes, think of someone who can run faster than your mother. Perhaps it is your father If you don't know about that, ask your parents about their running habits and see what they tell you.

Back to your dad, can he run faster than a dog? What about something even faster - maybe a car? Can you think of something faster than that? A plane, perhaps?

Planes are very fast indeed, but I suspect you're already thinking that I can be faster than a plane. After all, I have billions of brothers, I am millions of years old... So far, every time I ask you to think about my questions, I later tell you `think bigger` or `longer`. This time I am telling you `even faster`!

In fact, no one can move faster than me! Rays of light, such as myself, are the fastest things in the entire world! Nothing can outrun us, not even the fastest plane.

I am so fast, that by the time you pronounce your name, I can go from China to The Netherlands and back, and I will do it almost 20 times!

Let's try an experiment. Look for a map of the world, then find Beijing in China and Amsterdam in The Netherlands. If you can't find them, ask a friend to help you with that. When you're done, pronounce your name aloud. 

You can do it right now, one, two, three, go!


It probably took you a second to say your name, and this was just enough time for me to travel from one city to another, back and forth. That's pretty fast, isn't it?


It will take me a little bit over one second to go from the Earth to the Moon, that's how fast I am!


Now that you know how fast I am, let me tell you something else - I can't stop. In fact, if I stop - I disappear! So the only way for me to stay alive is to keep moving, otherwise I vanish.

So... I have no choice but to travel. And I learned to enjoy it too, otherwise it would be a great waste of time, wouldn't it?


-----------------

Mercury
=======

As soon as I took off from the Sun, I saw a little spinning ball nearby, it was Mercury. It took me around 3 minutes to get to it. You say 3 minutes is not that much time? Think about what you can do in 3 minutes... Get up, brush your teeth and get dressed? Or maybe that is how long it takes you to get home from the nearest bus-stop?

Remember, it takes a second for me to travel from the Earth to the Moon; now try to imagine what I can do in 3 minutes! That is 180 seconds (because every minute has 60 seconds, and if you multiply that by 3, you get 180), so I can go to the Moon and back 180 times while you're getting dressed. Cool, huh!?

Oh, wait... I just told you to multiply some numbers, but you probably don't know how to do that. Well, I'll tell you what, some time later I will try to teach you how to do that. Until then, just trust me. Oh, and yes - it wouldn't hurt if you ask your mom or dad to do the multiplications for us too, such that if I made a mistake, you can tell me about it.

But... let me go back to Mercury. It is a little gray rock, with many holes in it. These holes are called `craters`, they are formed when something falls on the surface of the planet.

![A photograph of a crater 308 on the Earth's Moon](http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/2368main_MM_Image_Feature_26_rs4.jpg "A crater on the Moon, surrounded by many smaller craters")

Have you ever thrown a pebble into a puddle? Or a rock in a pond? Go ahead and try it next time you're outside, if you haven't done so already. Notice that when the rock hits the water, a round hole is formed around it, along with some ripples. In a few moments, the water comes back and the hole is gone. After a while, the ripples fade away too.

A crater forms in a similar way, but unlike in the case of water - where in a few seconds everything comes back to normal, when a rock hits the ground - the hole is going to remain there for a very long time, maybe even forever!


![Caloris Basin, the largest crater on Mercury](https://raw.github.com/ralienpp/ray/master/images/caloris-basin.jpg "Caloris Basin")

Mercury is riddled with craters. Apparently, it was hit many times in the past, and not much has happened since then. If you look carefully, you will find a place called `Caloris Basin`, it is the largest crater I have ever seen. It is very large... How large? So large, that you can hardly see it is a crater, unless you look very carefully and notice its rounded shape and rim. It is about as large as Saudi Arabia, a country on Earth; try to find it on a map - so you can see what I am talking about.

Venus
=====

About 6 minutes after my departure from the Sun, another ball became visible in the distance. It was rotating, like Mercury, but unlike Mercury - it was bigger, very shiny and very smooth. I was eager to get closer and take a better look.

This is the planet Venus. It is covered by clouds and as you approach it, you can see that it appears to be of a greenish tint, almost gray. There were so many clouds that I could not see the surface at all. Does it have craters like Mercury? I cannot tell, the clouds cover absolutely everything.

I was very surprised to see that Venus is extremely hot. How hot? Well, we've done this before, we are not going to guess, we are going to... **Think!** Think of something very hot and remember how you felt when you touched that object.

If you ever saw how a candle burns, remember that the wax it was made of melted. Well, wax usually melts at a temperature of 60 degrees Celcius. Something hotter than that - water boils at 100 degrees Celcius. Give it a try once, have a look at a boiling pot of water while someone cooks dinner - see the bubbles and the vapours, that's what happens when water gets hot.

The temperature of Venus is even higher than that, at least 450 degrees Celsius! It is so hot, that if you leave a tin box on the surface - it will melt, just like the wax of a candle! 

What is a tin box? Tin is a metal that us usually used to make cans - next time you're going shopping, have a look at the shelves with canned fruits or canned sardines, those are usually stored in tin boxes.


What is that Celsius thing?
---------------------------

Sorry, I didn't explain that until now, you should have asked earlier. Next time you want to know something, just go ahead and ask.

So, Celsius degrees are a way to measure temperature, the name comes from a bright fellow named Anders Celsius, who lived in Sweden a few hundred years ago. When we talk about temperatures, we say `degrees Celsius` or we write `°C` - a little circle at the top and the letter `C`.

To put things into perspective, think of the hottest summer day you can remember. That summer day was very hot, I believe you; it was probably around 30 or 35 °C.  Remember, water boils at 100 °C (about three times hotter than the hottest day you can remember). And the temperature on Venus is around four times hotter than that.

Impressive, isn't it?  Now you probably wonder whether I didn't feel uncomfortable when I was visiting Venus. That's a good question, thank you for asking. Don't worry about me, I am used to hot places. 

When I was at the surface of the sun, the temperature there was at least 5000 °C. That is almost eleven times hotter than Venus, 500 times hotter than what it takes for water to boil, and around 160 times hotter than that hot summer day.

Like I said, don't worry about me - rays of light deal with such extreme conditions just fine. However, that is not the case for you, if you ever plan to visit Venus, you'll need to wear a special protective suit, otherwise you will melt, just like a candle!


Before I tell you about my next stop, remember::

	You can always ask questions if something is not clear, I don't mind. Actually, I love questions! So feel free to ask anytime!
	

If you have some unanswered questions about the things I already told you, I will answer them. Think about it for a while before we move on.



Earth
=====

After Venus I saw another spinning ball in the distance, it was very blue and it had other colours too - white, brown, green. I've never seen anything like that before. It was Earth, and it took me 8 minutes to get there.

Earth happens to be the place where you are now. Yes, right there, under your shoes - take a look, that's Earth! It is your home, just like the sun is my home.

I don't think that I have to tell you a lot about your own home, after all - you live there, so you know it better than I do.

However, there are a few things I want to share. A while ago we discussed days and nights, I told you that there is no night or day on the sun, and I will explain why you have them on Earth.


Day and night
-------------

Before I tell you, think about what all of the planets I told you about have in common. Feel free to go back and read the descriptions again.

If you paid attention, you saw that they have differences, for example - Venus is smooth, Mercury has craters. But think about what they have in common. As always, take your time, I'll wait.


You may have noticed that all of them are round and that all of them are spinning. Well, the spinning is what makes days and nights possible. The side that is facing the sun is lit - so there is day. The opposite side is in the shadow, it is dark - and we call it `the night`. The drawing below will make it clear.


![A schematic representation of day and night](https://raw.github.com/ralienpp/ray/master/images/day-and-night.png "The planet is illuminated by the Sun on one side - that is a day; the opposite side is in the shadow - that is the night. The line that separates them is the terminator")


Notice that line separating the day from the night, it is called `the terminator`, it means `ending`, indicating the place where the day ends and the night begins. I really like that name, it reminds me of a good friend of mine.


If the drawing is still not clear, you can try this experiment: find a lamp, turn it on and point it to a ball. Notice how one side of the ball is illuminated (this is just a fancy word for `covered with light`), and the other one is dark. Then spin the ball with your hand and watch what happens. 

One side is always lit, the other one is always in the shadow. This is how days and nights work.


Mars
====

After leaving Earth, I saw another object in the distance, as I got closer, I could see that... What did I see? Try and help me out here. You know what the previous planets had in common, so there are a few things you can tell me about Mars, right?

Think about it, I'll wait right here.


Yes, it is round; and yes, it is rotating. You were right!


Mars appears to be red, because it is mostly covered with `iron oxide` (which is just a fancy name for `rust`). Next time you go out, pay attention to the objects around you that are made of iron, find old pieces that are covered with rust - what colour are they?

There is something else you could do - next time you eat an apple, take a bite and leave the apple for a few minutes. The inner part should change its colour, it happens because the tiny pieces of iron contained in the apple are influenced by something in the air, called `oxygen`. The apple gets `oxidized`, which is just a fancy way of saying that `it was influenced by oxygen`. I know, these fancy names can be a little bit complicated, but don't worry - they're just names, there is nothing scarry about them.


Another interesting thing I saw on Mars was a place called `Olympus Mons`, it is the tallest mountain I have ever seen. The tallest mountain of your home-world is called `Everest`, and Olympus Mons is almost three times taller, can you imagine that?! I was really impressed!

Mars also has a lot of canyons - they look like very deep scratches on the surface. The canyons on Mars are wider and deeper than those on Earth.


I have to leave now, I see something enormous in the distance, I want to take a better look.



Jupiter
=======

Wow, you really need to take a look at this! I am approaching an incredibly huge ball, it is bigger than anything I have ever seen (except the Sun, of course), it is breathtakingly beautiful - this is Jupiter!

The colours are just amazing! Here, have a look at the pictures I brought for you:

![The planet Jupiter](http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/53255main_MM_image_feature_97_jwhires.jpg "Jupiter")


Ah, I really can't stop saying how super large Jupiter is, wow! For a comparison - if you take Earth, your home planet, and make a copy of it, you can fit over a thousand of those into Jupiter and still have some space left!

As I get closer, I can see that Jupiter has a lot of smaller balls rotating around it - they are its moons, and I can count at least 60 of them! The Earth has only one moon, and you call it `the Moon` - you see it at night, it looks beautiful, doesn't it?

Try to imagine what it would look like when you observe the night sky and you see more than one moon! Hmmm, I am sure that would be a great view. Unfortunately, I don't think we can go to Jupiter's surface and look at the sky from there - the problem is that Jupiter is made almost entirely from `gases` (yes, that's a fancy way to say `cloud`), so there is *no surface to walk on*! So the only way to picture that is to imagine it, at least for now... because I can't think of another way.

You must be surprised, right? No surface to walk on? Who would have thought? It is very strange, I agree. This also means that there are no craters on Jupiter, because there is no surface to hit. A falling rock would keep falling and falling, until it gets crushed by the weight of the clouds above it.

Jupiter's colours are very beautiful, the clouds move very fast and they go in different directions, this makes it look like some kind of a cake with many layers that have a mind of their own. See this video that I found for you, I hope you'll like it. I apologize for the video being black and white, but I didn't have a better camera at the time.


![Jupiter's great red spot, as seen by Voyager](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/790106-0203_Voyager_58M_to_31M_reduced.gif "Jupiter's great red spot")


If you pay attention, you will see a very large spot, it looks like a stain - it is a storm. It has a reddish colour, here is a better picture:

![Jupiter's great red spot, as seen by Voyager](https://raw.github.com/ralienpp/ray/master/images/jupiter-red-spot.png "Jupiter's great red spot")


It is so large that three Earths can fit into it. This is unthinkable, but *think about it anyway*. Try to remember a very windy day, perhaps a day in autumn? There was a storm and the trees were bent by the wind - you could always go home and enjoy the protection and comfort of your room. The giant storm on Jupiter, on the other hand, is so large, that you would probably get stuck in it forever. Of course, if you were a ray of light, like myself, you could get out of it before you reach the end of this sentence.
No, I don't think you can just wait until the storm is over. As far as I know, it has been there for hundreds of years and I don't know if it will ever stop. Talk to your friends, maybe they know something about it?


What do clouds weigh?
---------------------

I told you that a falling rock would be crushed by the weight of the clouds above it. Earth has clouds too, but you are not crushed by them. Why not?

In fact, it is simply because you are used to carrying the weight of the air above you, it was always there - so you can't tell what it would be like without it. It is surprising, but whenever you walk outside, there are about one thousand kilograms of air pushing you towards the ground!

You may not believe me, because you can't see it. Yes, the air is invisible, it is true; but if it weren't there - you would be unable to breathe. So the fact that you can breathe indicates that something is out there around you, even if you can't see it.



Europa
======

Before leaving Jupiter, I visited a snowball! That's what it looked like from the distance! Yes, I didn't expect that either!

Europa is a small world that rotates around Jupiter, just like the Moon spins around the Earth. Objects that revolve around another object are called `satellites`, so the Moon is a satellite of Earth and Europa is a satellite of Jupiter.

I have never seen such a world, it was absolutely white - unlike all the previous places I have been to. Europa seems to be completely frozen and covered with ice, no matter where you look, you see just ice, ice and ice. Sometimes, if you pay attention - you can see some ice too!



By the way, I know that `Europa` sounds a lot like `Europe` - but no, I did not mispronounce it. In fact, I learned that Europe is a place on Earth, both these names were inspired by a name of an ancient Greek goddess. Unfortunately I cannot remember any details about this goddess, so I would greatly appreciate it if you looked it up for me, so you could fill me in next time we see each other.

Sleighing or skiing on Europa must be a very fun activity, maybe one day I could try it. Beware though, the closer you get - the more becomes visible. Europa appears to have some scratches, those are cracks in the ice. Some of them can be very deep, they remind me of the canyons on Mars, though these are made from ice, rather than rock.

![Cracks on Europa](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Europa_g1_true.jpg "Europa, a closer look at the surface")



Ray, one of my best friends, told me that there is an enormous ocean under the ice crust of Europa. I haven't seen it with my own eyes, so I can't tell you whether it is true or not, but we can talk about it when you tell me about Europa, the Greek goddess.


Io
==

Io - that's a funny name, isn't it? It is another satellite of Jupiter, it is pretty small. It has a yellowish colour, sometimes it is dark brown. This one has a very peculiar feature that reminds me of Earth, your home planet.

You see, as I got closer to Io, I noticed some jets going out of it. No, nooooo... Not airplane jets, no, of course not! I refer to streams of something that was ejected from the surface.

I couldn't believe my eyes, but after squinting a little bit - I realized that Io has active volcanoes!  A volcano is like a mountain, but unlike a mountain - sometimes it spits things out, usually melted rock, which is so hot that it turns into a liquid and it flows downhill from the top of the volcano, just like water!

![Io](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Io_highest_resolution_true_color.jpg/600px-Io_highest_resolution_true_color.jpg "Io, a satellite of Jupiter")

There is one other observation that I have made - Io did not have as many craters as the Moon or Mercury. I think this happens because those volcanoes eject `lava` (that's another name for `melted rock`), which covers the hole in the ground. As the lava cools down, it becomes hard and that is how the surface is renewed.

Maybe, if there was a way to somehow look under the top layers of Io's surface, we could see remnants of craters that were there in the past? We ought to give it a try one day, maybe we could organize an expedition? Let me know if you're interested, I'll talk to my friends and see what we can do about it.



Why are all these worlds round?
-------------------------------

You may have noticed one detail - all the places I am talking about are round. What gives them this ball shape?

I don't know for sure, but I was talking to Ray once (another Ray) and she told me that there is a force called `gravity`, which makes objects attract each other. As they get closer - they merge and form a bigger object, they keep doing it over and over, getting bigger and bigger. As the size grows, an object attracts smaller objects with a greater strength - so it seems that the bigger something is, the more it attracts.

So, many millions of years ago, when Io was smaller, it didn't have a round shape. But as its gravity got stronger, it pulled everything towards the center, even the parts that were sticking up!

This is why planets and satellites that are large enough have a round shape, at least that's how I understand it.


Having fun with experiments
---------------------------

It is possible that you don't believe what I just told you about gravity. After all - you can't see it, so why would you believe it is there? Indeed, it is invisible, but there are ways to check whether it is there or not.

Pick up any object that you can find nearby. I do mean it, don't just imagine it; really- go ahead and pick something up, anything will do, except your mom's favourite glass vase (in a few moments you'll see why). Lift it up and then let it go.

Notice that it falls *down* - it is attracted by the Earth's gravity, which pulls the object towards the center of Earth. This confirms that there is something that attracts the object.

If the object remained where you left it - it would mean that it was not attracted by anything; if it went in a different direction - you could tell that there is definitely something out there, but it is not pulling the object towards the center of the Earth.

You should get used to invisible things, there are a lot of them out there. As long as you can find a way to ensure they really exist, you'll be fine. I'll tell you more about it when I have a chance to do so.



Saturn
======

My next stop was Saturn, a huge planet that looks a lot like Jupiter. It has many storms on it, it does not have a surface to walk on, and as you already know - it is round.

Saturn has something I haven't seen before - rings. At first they seemed bizare, but then I got used to seeing them around the planet. The closer I got - the better I saw the rings, which turned out to be smooth disks.

![Saturn](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Saturn-cassini-March-27-2004.jpg "Saturn and its rings")

As I got even closer, they turned out to be not so smooth at all - in fact, they are made of millions of little chunks of rock and ice that are `orbiting` Saturn. Yes, that's a new word, when I say `orbiting`, it is just a fancy way of saying `rotate around something`. For example, the Moon orbits the Earth, which means that the Moon is rotating around the Earth. Simple, isn't it?

It seems that Saturn is in a contest with Jupiter - who has the most satellites? They both have over 60 of them, so let's call it a tie for now.
